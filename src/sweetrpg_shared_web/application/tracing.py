"""tracing.py
Bootstraps distributed tracing, exported via OTLP/HTTP to the cluster's collector (Tempo) - see
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in the deployment configmap.

The tracer provider is created once and lives for the process's lifetime - it is never
shut down from within a setup helper. catalog-api shipped exactly that bug (a `defer
TeardownTracing()` scoped to a setup function instead of `main()`), which shut its tracer down
within milliseconds of startup and silently dropped every span with no visible error. Don't
repeat it here: if a teardown hook is ever added, it belongs on the WSGI server's actual
shutdown, not this function's return.
